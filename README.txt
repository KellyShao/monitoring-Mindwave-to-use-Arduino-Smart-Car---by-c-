Due to the status quo of EEG signal monitoring system, our team utilize EEG sensor and braincomputer interaction technology to connect the Mindwave (EEG signal collection equipment).
We are focused on the data analysis and application. The core of our project is to put data
¡°collection-transmission-identification¡± model into real product in order to monitoring and
analyzing real-time EEG signal.
We have achieved:
1. Build up the smart car with Arduino uno and an expansion board.
2. The connection of the Mindwave and Arduino Smart Car through Bluetooth serial port.
3. The Arduino program of ¡°Forward, TurnRight, TurnLeft, Pause¡± actions.
4. The C# program of 2 threads which read and write data alternately.
With the outcomes of our project, we could put this system into medical science and help
monitoring the EEG signal and figuring out people¡¯s state. According to this system, the old may
effectively avoid the tragedy of suffering from sudden illness while being ignored.
If we are able to get the great amount of EEG signal data of specific diseases according to the
clinical trials, we could build up the complete disease EEG signal database to compare the
collected signals with the peak values come from thousands of cases.
